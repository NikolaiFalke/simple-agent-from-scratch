# Agentic Framework Development for Symmedia Hub

## Project Overview
I'm rebuilding my complete agentic framework from the ground up to understand and fix issues from the previous implementation. The goal is to create a working system that interfaces with our platform's GraphQL API.

## System Architecture
- **Platform**: Symmedia Hub
- **Architecture**: Microservice-based with multiple subgraphs
- **Focus**: Services that don't require edge device connections
- **Approach**: Incremental capability building

## Starting Point: Tenant Service
We'll begin with the tenant service subgraph as our foundation.

## Known Challenges & Constraints
1. **Legacy Issues**: Many services have legacy code with incomplete implementations
2. **Filtering & Pagination**: Not correctly or fully implemented across services
3. **Data Fetching Strategy**: Need fallback mechanisms for unreliable endpoints
4. **Input Clarity**: Some mutations use unclear magic strings as inputs
5. **Incremental Evolution**: System must be built step-by-step with careful validation

## Development Principles
- Start simple and build incrementally
- Always implement fallback strategies for data fetching
- Validate each capability before adding the next
- Document magic strings and unclear inputs as we encounter them
- Focus on reliability over feature completeness initially

## Immediate Goals
1. Establish connection to tenant service GraphQL endpoint
2. Implement basic CRUD operations with proper error handling
3. Create robust data fetching patterns that can handle legacy inconsistencies
4. Build a foundation that can be extended to other services

## Request
Please help me design and implement this agentic framework, starting with the tenant service integration. I'll provide the subgraph schema once you're ready to begin implementation.

Focus on:
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Clear documentation of any workarounds for legacy issues
- Extensible patterns that can be applied to additional services
