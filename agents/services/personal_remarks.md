todo: before every body else should use it 
every tool needs a reference to postgres
 -> tool description + query



cache all ids for follow up questions related to the same entities

example:
give me all machine models

Here are the machine models with the NONE filter (public/unassigned templates):

Model Name: Info
Technology: Test
Brand: (none)
Tenant: HawkTeach
Public: Yes

Model Name: Tesla Model 3
Technology: Electric Vehicle
Brand: Tesla
Tenant: HawkTeach
Public: Yes
Documents: "Autopilot Features.pdf" available for this model

If you want, I can also provide a list of all machine models including those linked to specific tenants. Would you like that?
