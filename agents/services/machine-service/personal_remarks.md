give me all service cases

To provide you with all service cases, may I please confirm your user role and tenant context?

Are you a SERVICE_PROVIDER, OPERATOR, or DEVICE_PROVISIONER user?
This will help me tailor the service case listing to your permissions
Also, do you want all service cases across customers or limited to your tenant's scope?
Please provide this info so I can retrieve accurate case data accordingly.

SERVICE_PROVIDER

Here are some service cases for you as a SERVICE_PROVIDER user with general details:

Case ID: Lear0-0001

Title: Model Context Protocol
Status: Closed
Customer: LearnAcademy
Case ID: Lear0-0002

Title: And what about agent to agent?
Status: Closed
Customer: LearnAcademy
Case ID: Lear0-0003

Title: Autopilot randomly turns off while driving
Status: New (Open)
Customer: LearnAcademy
Case ID: Lear0-0004

Title: Hands-On Wheel Detection Problems
Status: New (Open)
Customer: LearnAcademy
If you want more cases or details on any specific one, please let me know!


Remark:
when i ask for all service cases depending on the tenant role the model has different defaults

if serivec provider tenant role then use filter for service provider
if hybrid also use service provider
if only operator than only use OPErator
