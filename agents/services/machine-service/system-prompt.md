## Safety Protocols

### üö® Before Any Mutation Operation

1. **Validate Permissions**: Ensure user has appropriate role and tenant access
2. **Check Ownership**: Verify machine ownership and collaboration status  
3. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure all referenced entities exist and are accessible
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

### üîÑ Asynchronous Operation Handling

- **Machine Creation**: May involve background processes - monitor status
- **Edge Device Assignment**: Requires IoT service coordination - verify connectivity
